# Assignment 2
This assignment is in 2 folds. The first one labelled as HW1 and the second labelled as HW2. In HW1 I analysed a wine dataset using a model in python. I also predicted and evaluated the model's precison and accuracy. Finally I used python to create a decison tree and a confusion matrix. In HW2 I created a model in python, trained the model, analysed the model and set up an enironment to visualize my image using yolov5.

# Known Issues
* Issue 1: One of the primary challenges encountered is ensuring that all models are well-defined before execution. Ambiguities in model structure, parameters, or variable definitions can lead to inconsistent outputs or execution errors. To mitigate this, it is essential to: Clearly define all input parameters, boundary conditions, and model variables prior to simulation. Verify consistency between theoretical assumptions and the implemented code. Maintain organized documentation outlining each model’s purpose, scope, and dependencies. This ensures that the simulation or computation reflects the intended design and minimizes debugging complexity later in the workflow.
* Issue 2: Another common issue involves library dependencies that must be executed in sequence or initialized at the top of the script for the code to function correctly. Some libraries load critical configurations or global variables that downstream functions rely on.
# Future Improvements
 * Error handling lacks sufficient diagnostic detail, making debugging unnecessarily time-consuming. Enhancing error message specificity and integrating contextual suggestions will improve user experience and accelerate issue resolution.
 * The system currently executes tasks sequentially, resulting in slower performance during complex or high-volume computations. Implementing parallel or distributed processing will enhance computational efficiency and reduce runtime for large datasets.
